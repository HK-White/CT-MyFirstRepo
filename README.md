**Code Temple has made learning Git/GitHub** easy. I mean that in an honest manner. The voiceover done by a computer model could be better as it messes some words up, and other times says them fine.
GitHub has been called "GyyteeHu-b" more than one time. But the material itself is extremely helpful and well thought out!
